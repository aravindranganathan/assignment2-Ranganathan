###### BASKETBALL<br>
**BASKETBALL** is MY FAVORITE **TEAM SPORT** <br>AS IT INVOLVES HIGH SCORING GAMES WITH AVERAGE OF 100 POINTS SCORED BY TEAM. EACH SUCCCESSFUL REGULAR SHOT IS AWARDED TWO OR THREE POINTS ACCORDING TO WHERE THE SHOT IS MADE FROM,WHILE THE SUCCESSFUL FREE THROW SHOTS ARE AWARDED ONE POINT. IN BASKETBALL TEAM WORK IS VERY IMPORTANT AS THE **FIVE PLAYERS** ON THE COURT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE TEAMS NEEDS TO BE AT THEIR BEST IN THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLE IN THE TEAM WHETHER IN THE OFFENSE OR IN THE DEFENSE OR CENTER.
